Website for ranking songs and saving the output to playlists.

As of right now what exists:
* basic backend api of categories that have a lot of playlists with songs;
* hierarchal cruds.

TO-DO (ideas for functions):
* front design;
* oauth;
* comparing songs function (compare playlist, compare artist discography, album etc.)
* saving comparisons as a playlist;
* sharing the playlist to friends;
* social media aspect of the site (following others, having a profile, page to see everyone's posts);
* discover something new - get a recommendation to rate something new either from friends or site;
* gamify - get points for rating things and enter a leaderboard for most ratings;
* compare other people's rating profiles with yours;
* match people with you based on rating likeness -> messaging;
* some extra design for after rating that shows the output, or general profile conclusion that creates a short design to showcase the main ratings or interests of user.
